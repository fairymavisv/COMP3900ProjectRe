# COMP3900ProjectRe
## Background
The project was completed in a collaborative group effort during the 2021 T3 semester. The only thing I regret a little is that the stock price forecast was not achieved, so I used the holiday time to update it.

## Frontend Scripts
Install NodeJS and run
`npm install --global yarn`
Check it after the installation
`yarn -- version`
In the frontend firectory, run on at once
`yarn install`
and launch the frontend
`yarn start`
