# COMP3900ProjectRe
## Background
The project was completed in a collaborative group effort during the 2021 T3 semester. The only thing I regret a little is that the stock price forecast was not achieved, so I used the holiday time to update it.

## Frontend Scripts
1. Install NodeJS and run
`npm install --global yarn`
2. Check it after the installation
`yarn -- version`
3. Run it at once in frontend directory
`yarn install`
4. launch the frontend in frontend directory
`yarn start`
